# Eventfolio

**Eventfolio** is a modern, privacy-focused, multi-calendar event manager for WordPress. Designed for organizations, communities, and clubs that value privacy, flexible participation, and performance, Eventfolio empowers trusted organizers while protecting members.

## Features

- **Multiple Calendars via Event Categories:**  
  - Create and manage multiple event categories, each with its own calendar view.
  - Events can be assigned to one or more categories, making it easy to organize regional, topical, or group-specific calendars.

- **Event Management:**  
  - Supports both one-time and recurring events.
  - Recurring events allow per-instance editing (change details for a single date without affecting the series).

- **Rich Event Details:**  
  - Each event includes title, description (with Markdown support), date/time, location (address or virtual link), assigned organizers, and RSVP/sign-up for members.

- **Privacy & Visibility Controls:**  
  - **Public:** Visible to everyone.
  - **Private (Teaser):** Title and date visible to all, details and RSVP require login and validation.
  - **Fully Private:** Only validated, logged-in users can see the event exists.
  - Global default and per-event override supported.

- **Access & Security:**  
  - Only validated members can RSVP and view private event details.
  - “Validated” status managed by admins or trusted organizers.

- **Organizer Permissions:**  
  - Organizers can create, edit, and delete only their own events.
  - Site admins retain global control.

- **User Experience:**  
  - Clean, responsive calendar and list views by category.
  - Attendee sign-up with one click.
  - Organizers can view and export attendee lists for their events.

- **Performance-Oriented:**  
  - Minimal bloat, fast queries, and only the features you need.

## Why Eventfolio?

Most commercial event calendar plugins are overloaded with unnecessary features, causing slowdowns and clutter. They also often lack privacy controls and are expensive or difficult to adapt.  
**Eventfolio** is built to be lightweight, open source, and tailored to organizations that value privacy, speed, and flexible participation.

## Philosophy

- **Privacy by Design:** Sensitive events are protected and visible only to trusted members.
- **Community-Driven:** Supports multiple calendars for any kind of group, organization, or club.
- **Performance:** No unnecessary bloat; fast, accessible for everyone.
- **Free & Open:** No licensing fees, no vendor lock-in. Built for the community, shared with everyone.
